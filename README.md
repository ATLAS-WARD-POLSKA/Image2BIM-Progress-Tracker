# Image2BIM-Progress-Tracker
Reporting Construction Progress in the BIM Model Based on Image Analysis

Atlas Ward aims to develop the BIM (Building Information Modeling) methodology within the organization to improve the efficiency and quality of the investments we undertake. We are seeking a solution that enables automatic reporting of construction progress through image analysis and integration with the BIM model. The solution/system should be capable of processing images from the construction site, identifying and classifying the progress, and updating the BIM model with the latest data.

The solution should specifically provide: 

1. **Data Collection**: A method for collecting images from the construction site, with photos taken from various perspectives to ensure a comprehensive overview of the progress.

2. **Image Analysis**: The use of image recognition technology to identify construction elements (e.g., walls, windows, doors), analyze changes in the construction status compared to previous images and the BIM model.

3. **Integration with the BIM Model**: Updating the BIM model with data related to construction progress (changes in the geometry of objects, the addition of new elements, marking completed work, etc.).

4. **Reporting and Visualization**: Generating reports that present construction progress in an accessible form (3D visualizations, charts, tables, etc.), which should be available to various project stakeholders, including engineers, project managers, and investors.

5. **Additional Features**: For example, forecasting the completion time based on the current progress, detecting potential delays and issues, and the possibility of integration with other construction project management systems.
